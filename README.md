# Introduction
A personal exercise in learning Data Structures and Algorithms. This repo is a place to publicly document my progress in this journey, as well as strengthen my git skills in a public setting. I plan to implement rudimentary versions of various data structures and the abstract data types that can be constructed using each given data structure in addition to essential algorithms.

# Credit
Heavily inspired by [jwasham's coding interview university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university). A very helpful repo for learning computer science and prepping for interviews. Many of the checklists I use here are directly from his, and the ones I create are based on the ones he made. I highly encourage you to check out his work!
